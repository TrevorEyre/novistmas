				<h1>What is Novistmas?</h1>
				<p>Novistmas is a fun new holiday on the first Saturday of November. On Novistmas we
				celebrate with traditions such as singing Novistmas Carols and having ugly sweater contests
				with family. Novistmas is fun because we can spend time with family. It also gives us
				another holiday to get excited about between Halloween and Christmas.</p>

						<h2>Food Traditions</h2>
							<p>Our food traditions are men cooking instead of women, drinking eggnog, and eating rice
							pudding (that the men cook)</p>
							<p>While girls have done all the cooking the whole year, men(for the first time ever) are
							replacing the women's role. From the whatever is for dinner to the rice pudding for desert
							is cooked by men. We also drink lots of eggnog. Personally, Novistmas is the only holiday
							I have ever had eggnog with.</p>

						<h2> Caroling </h2>
							<p>Every family makes carols and sings it to everybody, hoping to win a trophy</p><p id="bigger">The trophy of shame that is</p>
							<p>A few months just before Novistmas you make up a Novistmas carol to sing to your relatives. Everybody makes one and everybody sings them, hoping to get the 
							winner's trophy. But if they don't, then you will probably hate the winner for the rest of the day. . . or week. . . or month. . . or year. . . or decade. . . or 
							century. . . or mellenium. . . or generation. . . or the rest of your life. But hey! At least they won't get it next year because it's always passed on. And when 
							the day finally comes and you get it, you finally will have the right to spit in your hated one's face, "IN YO' FACE!! BRUDDA!!!!!!"</p>

				<p>In this section we dive into the chaos and explain how you can do Novistmas with your family.</p>
				<p>To start, you need to tell your freinds and family about Novistmas. Get them on this website and
				show them all the traditions.</p>
				<p>You need to find a place to have your Novistmas party. You will want it to have room for your whole family. It is also a good idea to have a nice hallway for the ugly sweater catwalk.   </p>
				<p>Next, find a good time for your Novistmas party. Try to make it so there aren't any scheduling conflicts, so your whole family can be there. Tell everyone beforehand that 
				you are having an ugly sweater party and to have a sweater made. You can look at the pictures above to get some ideas.</p>
				<p>Have a plan for what order you are doing things in before you tell everyone about the party. For example:</p>
				<p>1. people arrive</p>
				<p>2. Kids play and adults talk while the men make dinner</p>
				<p>3. Dinner</p>
				<p>4. Ugly Sweater Contest</p>
				<p>5. Carol contest</p>
				<p>6. Everyone opens gifts</p>
				<p>7. Cleanup</p>
				<p>8. Everyone leaves</p>
				<p> Now that you have a rough idea of what your party will be like, you need to find the supplies for it. Here are things you will need: Ugly sweater trophy for kids, Ugly sweater trophy for adults, Best carol award, Decorations(optianal), ingredients for dinner, place for the party.</p>
				<p>I hope that now you will be able to put on your own Novistmas party. Thank-you for reading this guide!</p>
